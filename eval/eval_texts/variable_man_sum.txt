War‑bent 22nd‑century Earth relies on giant SRB computers and the unfinished faster‑than‑light “Icarus” bomb to break the Proxima Jorblax Empire’s grip, but when a time‑research accident pulls 1913 handyman Edward Milsom into the future his intuitive, boundary‑less repair genius baffles the computers, panics Security Commissioner Paddington, and ultimately rewires Icarus not to explode but to decelerate safely from FTL speed; Paddington’s attempt to kill Milsom and launch the war backfires, the Terran fleet is defeated, and only after the debacle does physicist Sherikov realize Milsom has solved the fundamental FTL‑re‑entry problem, giving humanity true interstellar travel and rendering the lost war irrelevant—while the burned but alive “variable man,” awaiting return to his own time, is already studying a new device to fix.
